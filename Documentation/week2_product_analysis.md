## Product Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### Critical Risks (High Impact, High Probability)

#### Risk 1: Apple Compression Framework API Complexity

**Description:** Apple's Compression Framework stream API may be more complex than anticipated, requiring low-level C API usage with manual memory management.

**Impact:** High (blocks all algorithm implementations)
**Probability:** High (API is C-based, not Swift-native)
**Severity:** CRITICAL

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Prototype First:** Create standalone Swift playground to test Apple Compression Framework stream API before implementation
2. **Reference Implementation:** Study open-source projects using Apple Compression Framework
3. **Spike Time-Box:** Allocate first 2 days of Week 2 for technical spike on compression API
4. **Fallback Plan:** If stream API is too complex, implement in-memory compression first (load entire file), then optimize to streaming in Week 4
5. **Expert Consultation:** Leverage Context7 MCP tool for Apple Compression Framework documentation and examples

**Success Criteria:** Working stream-based compression demo by Day 2 of Week 2

---

#### Risk 2: Data Integrity Issues in Stream Processing

**Description:** Stream-based processing with buffering may introduce data corruption bugs that are difficult to detect and debug.

**Impact:** Critical (corrupts user data - unacceptable for MVP)
**Probability:** Medium (complex buffer management)
**Severity:** CRITICAL

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Checksum Validation:** Implement SHA-256 checksums for round-trip validation in integration tests
2. **Known Test Vectors:** Use known input/output pairs for algorithm validation
3. **Incremental Testing:** Test with small files (1KB) first, gradually increase to 100MB
4. **Byte-Perfect Comparison:** All integration tests must verify byte-perfect round-trip
5. **Edge Case Testing:** Test files with sizes that are not multiples of buffer size
6. **Buffer Overflow Protection:** Use Swift's bounds-checked arrays and Data types

**Success Criteria:** 100% success rate on round-trip tests with files from 1KB to 100MB

---

#### Risk 3: Memory Management and Leaks

**Description:** Stream processing and C API integration may introduce memory leaks or excessive memory usage, violating the < 100MB requirement.

**Impact:** High (violates MVP requirements, fails on large files)
**Probability:** Medium (C API requires manual memory management)
**Severity:** HIGH

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Use Swift Defer:** Leverage Swift's defer for guaranteed cleanup
2. **Instruments Profiling:** Use Xcode Instruments to detect memory leaks
3. **Automated Memory Tests:** Add XCTest memory pressure tests
4. **Buffer Size Tuning:** Test with various buffer sizes (4KB, 64KB, 256KB) to optimize
5. **Reference Counting Audit:** Manually audit all C API usage for proper release
6. **Continuous Monitoring:** Run memory tests on every commit

**Success Criteria:** 100MB file processing with < 100MB peak memory usage, zero leaks detected

---

### High Risks (High Impact, Medium Probability)

#### Risk 4: File System Permission Handling

**Description:** macOS file system permissions and sandboxing may cause unexpected errors in file operations.

**Impact:** Medium (affects usability but not data integrity)
**Probability:** Medium (sandboxing varies by macOS version)
**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Explicit Permission Checks:** Check read/write permissions before operations
2. **Clear Error Messages:** Translate permission errors to actionable user messages
3. **Test Multiple Locations:** Test with files in Documents, Desktop, Downloads, /tmp
4. **Sandbox Testing:** Test with and without sandboxing enabled
5. **User Guidance:** Document permission requirements in error messages

**Success Criteria:** Clear error messages for all permission scenarios

---

#### Risk 5: Cross-Algorithm Compatibility Issues

**Description:** Different algorithms may have subtly different behavior or requirements that cause integration issues.

**Impact:** Medium (some algorithms may not work correctly)
**Probability:** Medium (4 different algorithms with different characteristics)
**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Uniform Interface:** Ensure all algorithms implement identical protocol interface
2. **Comprehensive Testing:** Test each algorithm with same test suite
3. **Edge Case Coverage:** Test each algorithm with edge cases (empty files, huge files, binary, text)
4. **Cross-Validation:** Compare results with native macOS compression tools where possible
5. **Algorithm Isolation:** Keep each algorithm implementation independent

**Success Criteria:** All 4 algorithms pass identical test suite with 100% success rate

---

### Medium Risks (Medium Impact, Low Probability)

#### Risk 6: Performance Below Expectations

**Description:** Compression/decompression performance may not meet the < 5 second target for 100MB files.

**Impact:** Low (acceptable if data integrity maintained)
**Probability:** Low (Apple framework is optimized)
**Severity:** LOW

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Benchmark Early:** Establish baseline performance in first week
2. **Buffer Optimization:** Tune buffer sizes for performance
3. **Algorithm Selection:** Document performance characteristics to guide user choice
4. **Progressive Enhancement:** Optimize in Week 4 if needed, not blocking for MVP
5. **Realistic Expectations:** 5 second target is aspirational, 10 seconds acceptable for MVP

**Success Criteria:** Performance documented, no data integrity issues

---

#### Risk 7: Test Suite Execution Time

**Description:** Integration tests with 100MB files may cause test suite to run too slowly, impacting development velocity.

**Impact:** Low (affects development speed, not product quality)
**Probability:** Medium (large file tests are slow)
**Severity:** LOW

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Tiered Testing:** Separate fast unit tests from slow integration tests
2. **Selective Test Execution:** Run large file tests only on CI or manually
3. **Test Data Generation:** Generate test files on-demand rather than committing large files
4. **Parallel Execution:** Run integration tests in parallel where possible
5. **Time Budgets:** Set 5 second limit for unit tests, 30 second limit for integration tests

**Success Criteria:** Unit tests run in < 5 seconds, integration tests in < 30 seconds

### Demo Script for Week 2 Completion

The following should be demonstrable in terminal:

```bash
# 1. Run all tests
swift test
# Expected: 96+ tests passing, 0 failures, < 35 seconds total

# 2. Create test file
echo "Hello, SwiftCompress!" > test.txt

# 3. Manual compression test (using test harness, not CLI yet)
# This would be done via test code since CLI isn't built yet
# Integration tests serve as the demo for Week 2

# 4. Verify round-trip with integration test
swift test --filter CompressionIntegrationTests
# Expected: All round-trip tests pass for all 4 algorithms
```

## Recommendations

### Implementation Approach

1. **Start with Technical Spike** (Days 1-2)
   - Create standalone Swift playground for Apple Compression Framework exploration
   - Implement basic stream-based compression/decompression proof-of-concept
   - Validate stream API usage and memory characteristics
   - Document findings before proceeding to full implementation

2. **Incremental Implementation** (Days 3-5)
   - Implement FileSystemHandler with unit tests (Day 3)
   - Implement StreamProcessor with unit tests (Day 4)
   - Implement LZFSE algorithm first (Day 5) - validate entire stack works

3. **Parallel Algorithm Development** (Days 6-7)
   - Once LZFSE works, other algorithms can be implemented in parallel
   - All algorithms share same protocol, reducing interdependency
   - Each algorithm should take 4-6 hours to implement and test

4. **Integration and Validation** (Days 8-10)
   - Integration tests with real files (Day 8)
   - Performance benchmarking (Day 9)
   - Bug fixes and refinement (Day 10)

### Testing Approach

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
   - Write protocol and tests first, then implementation
   - Ensures all error scenarios are covered
   - Maintains high coverage automatically

2. **Tiered Test Execution**
   - Fast unit tests (< 5 seconds) run on every save
   - Integration tests (< 30 seconds) run before commits
   - Performance tests run manually or on CI

3. **Data Integrity Priority**
   - Every algorithm must pass round-trip tests with 100% success rate
   - No data corruption is acceptable
   - When in doubt, fail safely with clear error

### Risk Management

1. **Daily Risk Assessment**
   - Review critical risks at daily standup
   - Escalate blockers immediately
   - Adjust scope if needed (prefer 3 working algorithms to 4 broken ones)

2. **Fallback Options**
   - If stream API proves too complex: implement in-memory compression first
   - If Apple framework has bugs: document limitations and consider Phase 2 workarounds
   - If performance is poor: document actual performance and optimize in Week 4

3. **Quality Gates**
   - Do not proceed to Week 3 unless all acceptance criteria are met
   - Data integrity is non-negotiable
   - Test coverage below 85% requires review and justification

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Test Coverage | ≥ 85% | Xcode coverage report |
| Test Pass Rate | 100% | `swift test` output |
| Unit Test Speed | < 5 seconds | XCTest execution time |
| Integration Test Speed | < 30 seconds | XCTest execution time |
| Memory Usage (100MB file) | < 100MB peak | Xcode Instruments |
| Round-Trip Success Rate | 100% | Integration test results |
| Compression Speed (100MB, LZ4) | < 5 seconds | Performance benchmark |
| Algorithms Implemented | 4 (LZFSE, LZ4, Zlib, LZMA) | Code review |

### Qualitative Metrics

- **Code Readability:** Can a new developer understand the infrastructure code?
- **Error Clarity:** Are error messages from infrastructure layer actionable?
- **Architecture Compliance:** Does infrastructure properly implement domain protocols?
- **Testability:** Are components easy to test in isolation?

## Conclusion

Week 1 has successfully established a solid foundation for the SwiftCompress MVP. The project is well-positioned to tackle Week 2's infrastructure challenges.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Foundation is Solid:** 48 tests passing, 90%+ coverage, zero dependency violations
2. **Week 2 is Highest Risk:** File system and compression framework integration are critical path
3. **Mitigation in Place:** Clear user stories, risk mitigation strategies, and acceptance criteria
4. **Quality Focus:** Data integrity is non-negotiable, test coverage is mandatory
5. **Incremental Approach:** Technical spike first, then incremental implementation with TDD

**Next Steps:**

1. Begin Week 2 Day 1 with technical spike on Apple Compression Framework
2. Implement FileSystemHandler with comprehensive tests
3. Implement StreamProcessor with memory validation
4. Implement all 4 algorithms with round-trip validation
5. Conduct integration testing with real files
6. Performance benchmark and document results
7. Validate all acceptance criteria before proceeding to Week 3

**Risk Alert:** Week 2 introduces the highest technical risk in the MVP. Daily monitoring of progress against acceptance criteria is recommended. If critical blockers arise (Apple framework API issues, data integrity problems), escalate immediately and consider scope adjustment.
