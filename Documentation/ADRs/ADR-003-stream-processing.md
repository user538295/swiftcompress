## Context

SwiftCompress must compress and decompress files of varying sizes:
- Small files: < 1 MB (text files, scripts)
- Medium files: 1-100 MB (documents, images)
- Large files: 100 MB - several GB (videos, disk images, backups)

### Challenges with Different Approaches

**1. Load Entire File into Memory**
```swift
let data = try Data(contentsOf: inputFileURL)
let compressed = try algorithm.compress(input: data)
try compressed.write(to: outputFileURL)
```

**Problems**:
- Large files consume excessive memory (1 GB file → 1 GB+ RAM)
- Risk of out-of-memory crashes
- Poor performance with limited RAM
- Not scalable to larger files

**2. Stream Processing**
```swift
let inputStream = InputStream(fileAtPath: inputPath)
let outputStream = OutputStream(toFileAtPath: outputPath)
// Process in chunks
```

**Benefits**:
- Constant memory usage regardless of file size
- Can handle files larger than available RAM
- Better performance through buffering
- Standard pattern for file I/O

### Requirements

- Support files up to several GB without memory issues
- Maintain reasonable performance for all file sizes
- Provide consistent memory footprint
- Enable future optimizations (parallel processing, progress reporting)

---

## Decision

We will use **stream-based processing** for all file compression and decompression operations, processing data in fixed-size chunks rather than loading entire files into memory.

### Architecture

```swift
protocol StreamProcessorProtocol {
    /// Process compression with streaming
    func processCompression(
        input: InputStream,
        output: OutputStream,
        algorithm: CompressionAlgorithmProtocol,
        bufferSize: Int
    ) throws

    /// Process decompression with streaming
    func processDecompression(
        input: InputStream,
        output: OutputStream,
        algorithm: CompressionAlgorithmProtocol,
        bufferSize: Int
    ) throws
}
```

### Processing Algorithm

1. **Initialize**
   - Open input and output streams
   - Allocate read and write buffers (default: 64 KB)
   - Initialize compression algorithm state

2. **Process Loop**
   - Read chunk from input stream (up to buffer size)
   - Process chunk through compression algorithm
   - Write result to output stream
   - Repeat until input exhausted

3. **Finalize**
   - Flush any remaining buffered data
   - Close streams
   - Clean up resources

### Buffer Size

**Default**: 64 KB (65,536 bytes)

**Rationale**:
- Apple's recommended buffer size for stream operations
- Good balance between memory usage and I/O efficiency
- Matches typical file system block sizes
- Allows efficient processing with minimal memory

### Implementation Pattern

```swift
class StreamProcessor: StreamProcessorProtocol {
    func processCompression(
        input: InputStream,
        output: OutputStream,
        algorithm: CompressionAlgorithmProtocol,
        bufferSize: Int
    ) throws {
        input.open()
        defer { input.close() }

        output.open()
        defer { output.close() }

        var success = false
        defer {
            if !success {
                // Cleanup partial output on failure
            }
        }

        let buffer = UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt8>.allocate(capacity: bufferSize)
        defer { buffer.deallocate() }

        while input.hasBytesAvailable {
            let bytesRead = input.read(buffer, maxLength: bufferSize)
            guard bytesRead > 0 else { break }

            let chunk = Data(bytes: buffer, count: bytesRead)
            let processedChunk = try algorithm.compress(input: chunk)

            try writeToStream(output, data: processedChunk)
        }

        success = true
    }
}
```

### Algorithm Interface

Algorithms support both in-memory and streaming operations:

```swift
protocol CompressionAlgorithmProtocol {
    // In-memory (convenience methods for small data)
    func compress(input: Data) throws -> Data
    func decompress(input: Data) throws -> Data

    // Stream-based (for file operations)
    func compressStream(
        input: InputStream,
        output: OutputStream,
        bufferSize: Int
    ) throws

    func decompressStream(
        input: InputStream,
        output: OutputStream,
        bufferSize: Int
    ) throws
}
```

## Rationale

### Why Stream Processing?

**1. Scalability**
- Handles files of any size with constant memory
- 10 MB file and 10 GB file use same ~64 KB RAM
- No artificial file size limits

**2. Performance**
- Buffered I/O is more efficient than random access
- Sequential read/write optimized by OS
- Can start writing output before reading entire input
- Enables future pipeline optimizations

**3. Resource Management**
- Predictable memory usage
- No risk of out-of-memory crashes
- Better system resource utilization
- Multiple concurrent operations possible

**4. Apple Framework Compatibility**
- Apple Compression Framework supports streaming
- Foundation's Stream API is standard approach
- Consistent with macOS I/O patterns

**5. Future Extensibility**
- Easy to add progress reporting (bytes processed / total bytes)
- Can implement parallel processing (multiple streams)
- Supports stdin/stdout piping (Phase 3)
- Can add throttling or rate limiting

### Why 64 KB Buffer?

**Performance Testing**:
- Smaller buffers (4 KB, 8 KB): More system calls, lower throughput
- 64 KB: Optimal balance for most file systems
- Larger buffers (256 KB, 1 MB): Diminishing returns, higher memory

**Industry Standard**:
- Apple recommends 64 KB for stream operations
- Many compression tools use similar buffer sizes
- File system block sizes often 4-64 KB

**Memory Efficiency**:
- 64 KB is negligible RAM usage
- Allows many concurrent operations
- Room for additional buffers (read + write)

### Alternative Approaches Considered

**1. Memory-Mapped Files**
```swift
let data = try Data(contentsOf: fileURL, options: .mappedIfSafe)
```

**Rejected Because**:
- Still requires compression of entire file at once
- Apple Compression Framework doesn't support mapped memory directly
- Less portable across file systems
- Doesn't solve memory issues for very large files

**2. Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) Concurrent Processing**
```swift
let queue = DispatchQueue(label: "compression", attributes: .concurrent)
// Process chunks in parallel
```

**Deferred to Phase 3**:
- Adds significant complexity
- Compression algorithms may not be thread-safe
- Sequential I/O often faster than parallel on single drive
- Can be added later without architectural changes

**3. Fixed File Size Limit**
"Don't support files > X MB"

**Rejected Because**:
- Arbitrary limitations frustrate users
- Doesn't align with CLI tool expectations
- Stream processing solves problem elegantly
- No reason to impose artificial limits

**4. Async/Await Streaming (Swift Concurrency)**
```swift
for try await chunk in inputStream.bytes {
    let processed = try algorithm.compress(chunk)
    try await outputStream.write(processed)
}
```

**Deferred to Future**:
- Swift 5.5+ only (limits macOS compatibility)
- Synchronous I/O is simpler for CLI
- Can migrate later without breaking changes
- MVP doesn't require concurrency benefits

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Define Stream Processor Protocol

```swift
// Sources/Domain/Protocols/StreamProcessor.swift
protocol StreamProcessorProtocol {
    func processCompression(
        input: InputStream,
        output: OutputStream,
        algorithm: CompressionAlgorithmProtocol,
        bufferSize: Int
    ) throws

    func processDecompression(
        input: InputStream,
        output: OutputStream,
        algorithm: CompressionAlgorithmProtocol,
        bufferSize: Int
    ) throws
}
```

### Step 2: Implement Stream Processor

```swift
// Sources/Infrastructure/StreamProcessor.swift
final class StreamProcessor: StreamProcessorProtocol {
    private let defaultBufferSize = 65_536  // 64 KB

    func processCompression(...) throws {
        // Implementation with proper resource management
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Update Algorithm Protocol

```swift
protocol CompressionAlgorithmProtocol {
    // Add stream methods
    func compressStream(
        input: InputStream,
        output: OutputStream,
        bufferSize: Int
    ) throws
}
```

### Step 4: Implement Stream Support in Algorithms

Each algorithm implements streaming using Apple Compression Framework's streaming API:

```swift
func compressStream(input: InputStream, output: OutputStream, bufferSize: Int) throws {
    input.open()
    defer { input.close() }

    output.open()
    defer { output.close() }

    // Use compression_stream from Compression framework
    var stream = compression_stream()
    var status = compression_stream_init(&stream, COMPRESSION_STREAM_ENCODE, COMPRESSION_LZFSE)
    defer { compression_stream_destroy(&stream) }

    // Process in chunks
    // ...
}
```

### Step 5: Update Compression Engine

```swift
class CompressionEngine {
    let streamProcessor: StreamProcessorProtocol

    func compress(inputPath: String, outputPath: String, algorithmName: String) throws {
        let algorithm = try getAlgorithm(named: algorithmName)

        let inputStream = InputStream(fileAtPath: inputPath)!
        let outputStream = OutputStream(toFileAtPath: outputPath, append: false)!

        try streamProcessor.processCompression(
            input: inputStream,
            output: outputStream,
            algorithm: algorithm,
            bufferSize: 65_536
        )
    }
}
```

### Step 6: Resource Management Pattern

Use defer for guaranteed cleanup:

```swift
func processFile() throws {
    let stream = openStream()
    defer { stream.close() }  // Always executed

    var success = false
    defer {
        if !success {
            // Cleanup partial output
            deletePartialFile()
        }
    }

    // Process...

    success = true
}
```

### Step 7: Error Handling

Handle stream-specific errors:

```swift
guard input.streamStatus != .error else {
    throw InfrastructureError.streamReadFailed(
        underlyingError: input.streamError ?? NSError(...)
    )
}
```

## Validation Criteria

This decision is successfully implemented when:

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Compressing 1 GB file uses < 100 MB RAM
2. **No Size Limits**: Can compress files up to available disk space
3. **Performance**: 100 MB file compresses in < 5 seconds (LZFSE)
4. **Resource Management**: All streams properly closed even on errors
5. **Error Recovery**: Partial output cleaned up on failure
6. **Test Coverage**: Stream processing has 85%+ test coverage
7. **Integration Tests**: Successfully compress/decompress files from 1 MB to 1 GB

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Performance (LZFSE algorithm, modern Mac)

| File Size | Compression Time | Memory Usage |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| 1 MB      | < 0.1s          | ~64 KB       |
| 10 MB     | < 0.5s          | ~64 KB       |
| 100 MB    | < 5s            | ~64 KB       |
| 1 GB      | < 50s           | ~64 KB       |

### Measured vs. In-Memory

Stream processing should be within 10% of in-memory processing speed for large files, while using 99% less memory.

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Progress Reporting

```swift
protocol StreamProcessorProtocol {
    func processCompression(
        input: InputStream,
        output: OutputStream,
        algorithm: CompressionAlgorithmProtocol,
        bufferSize: Int,
        progressHandler: ((Int64, Int64) -> Void)?  // bytesProcessed, totalBytes
    ) throws
}
```

### Phase 3: stdin/stdout Support

Streaming architecture naturally supports piping:

```bash
cat large.txt | swiftcompress c -m lzfse -o compressed.lzfse
swiftcompress x compressed.lzfse -m lzfse | less
```

### Phase 4: Parallel Processing

Process multiple chunks concurrently:

```swift
let queue = DispatchQueue(label: "compression", attributes: .concurrent)
// Split file into chunks, compress in parallel, reassemble
```

### Phase 5: Resumable Operations

Checkpoint progress for very large files:

```swift
// Save state periodically
// Resume from last checkpoint on interruption
```
