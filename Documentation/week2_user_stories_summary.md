## Implementation Order (Recommended)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-3)
1. **Technical Spike** (Days 1-2): Apple Compression Framework exploration
2. **US-W2-01**: FileSystemHandler (Day 3)

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (Days 4-5)
3. **US-W2-02**: StreamProcessor (Day 4)
4. **US-W2-03**: LZFSE Algorithm (Day 5) - validates entire stack

### Phase 3: Algorithm Suite (Days 6-7)
5. **US-W2-04, US-W2-05, US-W2-06**: LZ4, Zlib, LZMA (parallel development)
6. **US-W2-07**: Unit Tests (concurrent with implementation using TDD)

### Phase 4: Validation (Days 8-10)
7. **US-W2-08**: Integration Tests (Day 8)
8. **US-W2-09**: Performance Benchmarks (Day 9)
9. **Bug Fixes & Polish** (Day 10)

## Critical Success Factors

### Must Have (Week 2 Acceptance)
- [ ] All 4 algorithms compress and decompress successfully
- [ ] Round-trip tests pass with 100% success rate (data integrity)
- [ ] 100MB file processes with < 100MB memory usage
- [ ] 96+ total tests passing (48 from Week 1 + 48 from Week 2)
- [ ] 85%+ test coverage on Infrastructure layer
- [ ] All error scenarios tested and handled

### Nice to Have (Can defer to Week 4)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented
- [ ] Compression speed meets < 5 second target
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified (Zlib with gzip)

---

## Risk Watch List

### Critical Risks
1. **Apple Compression Framework Complexity** - Mitigate with Day 1-2 technical spike
2. **Data Integrity Issues** - Mitigate with checksum validation and known test vectors
3. **Memory Management** - Mitigate with Swift defer and Instruments profiling

### Early Warning Indicators
- Technical spike not complete by end of Day 2 → Escalate
- Round-trip tests failing → Stop and fix before proceeding
- Memory usage > 100MB on 100MB file → Investigate buffer sizing
- Test coverage < 80% → Review test strategy
