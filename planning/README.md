# Historical Planning Documents

This folder contains phase-specific planning and design documents from the development process. These are archived for historical reference.

## Folder Structure

## Current Architecture

**For current architecture documentation**, see:
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](../Documentation/ARCHITECTURE.md) - Central architecture hub
- [component_specifications.md](../Documentation/component_specifications.md) - Component catalog
- [ADRs/](../Documentation/ADRs/) - Architecture Decision Records

These archived documents show the evolution of design decisions but may not reflect the final implementation.

## Phase-Specific Documents

### Phase 1: MVP Implementation

Located in `phase-1/week-2/`:
- `week2_product_analysis.md` - Product analysis from Week 2
- `week2_user_stories_summary.md` - User stories from Week 2

**Status**: ✅ Complete - All features implemented and tested

### Phase 3: stdin/stdout Streaming

Located in `phase-3/`:
- `stdin-stdout-SUMMARY.md` - Executive summary
- `stdin-stdout-design-specification.md` - Design specifications
- `stdin-stdout-implementation-guide.md` - Implementation guide
- `stdin-stdout-architecture-diagrams.md` - Architecture diagrams

**Status**: ✅ Complete - Unix pipeline support fully implemented

**Current Documentation**: See [ADR-007: stdin/stdout Streaming](../Documentation/ADRs/ADR-007-stdin-stdout-streaming.md) for the accepted design decision.

## Using These Documents

These documents are useful for:
- Understanding the design evolution
- Learning about design alternatives that were considered
- Historical context for architectural decisions
- Examples of planning documentation

**Important**: Always refer to the current documentation in the main Documentation/ folder and ADRs for accurate implementation details.
